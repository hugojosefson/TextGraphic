/**
 *  TextGraphic is designed to be destination-independent. Some may use it to
 *  render text in a browser, but it can also be used to render text in a
 *  terminal. The way this independence is designed is by having a protocol
 *  that defines how style is rendered. Each new target platform is defined
 *  by implementing the `StyleRendererProtocol`.
 *
 *  The design philosophy here is to draw a border between the `ViewProtocol`
 *  and `StyleRendererProtocol` that gives the view implementors enough
 *  freedom to create new views but also keeps them from shooting themselves
 *  in the foot.
 *
 *  TextGraphic is about text and every implementation of a textual markup
 *  evolves some sort of a tag mechanism where some form of an indication
 *  marks the starting point of the markup and one other marks the ending.
 *
 *  For example these are 3 different ways of making the text word "fox"
 *  bold in different platforms:
 *  - _Markdown_: The quick brown `**`fox`**` jumps over the lazy dog.
 *  - _ANSI Terminal_: The quick brown `\x1b[1;m`fox`\x1b[0;m` jumps over the lazy dog.
 *  - _HTML_: The quick brown `<b>`fox`</b>` jumps over the lazy dog.
 *
 *  As it is easy to observe, the only different factor in the actual
 *  render is how one platform defines its markup indications. Therefore
 *  the separation of concerns within the TextGraphic is that the the renderer
 *  of the view (the `.styledForm` property) is responsible for inserting
 *  the appropriate style indicators&mdash;which in TextGraphic jargon is
 *  called the _styling info_&mdash;and the style renderer is tasked with
 *  forming the _Style_ into appropriate _StyleInfo_ for the particular
 *  section.
 *
 *  As each target may have different styling options, each platform that
 *  is defined for the TextGraphic needs to have two standards implemented.
 *
 *  1. A `ColorType` that extends the `PortableColor`.
 *  2. An `EnvironmentStyleSetting` that extends the `PortableStyle<ColorType>`
 *
 *  These two types define the the styling possibilities of the target
 *  platform, while extending the `PortableColor` and the `PortableStyle`
 *  they implement a minimum intersection of styling that can be rendered
 *  almost anywhere.
 *
 *  The nature of the result render is a character matrix in which some
 *  characters are styled. Therefore there are 3 distinct styling sets
 *  which the style renderer has to have an answer for:
 *
 *  1.  How to wrap a styled section of a line?
 *  2.  How to wrap each row (line) of the final render?
 *  3.  How to wrap the whole render matrix?
 *
 *  And then there are more styling problems that are unique to each
 *  target and therefore a responsibility for the style renderer.
 *
 *  4.  What additional color formats does the environment offer?
 *      (the `ColorType`)
 *  5.  What additional styling options does the environment offer?
 *      (the `EnvironmentStyleSetting`)
 *  6.  What is the default settings look like?
 *  7.  How do you merge a previous setting with a new one?
 *
 *  These should all be addressed within the implementations of the
 *  style renderer.
